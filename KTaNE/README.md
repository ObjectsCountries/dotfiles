# KTaNE Files

These files are to be used for setting up [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](https://keeptalkinggame.com) on a new computer.

On Linux, [modSettings.xml](modSettings.xml) and [playerSettings.xml](playerSettings.xml) should be dropped in `~/.config/unity3d/Steel Crate Games/Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes/`, and the mod settings files in the subsequent `modSettings` folder.
